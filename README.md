# PyBer Analysis Report

## Background and Results

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze ride data from the cities that PyBer has, so far, provided it's ride-sharing services in and to generate market analysis data aggregated by the type of city where each ride took place in. Each city where a PyBer ride took place is assigned one of the following city types:

* Urban
* Suburban
* Rural

PyBer management will use this market analysis data to improve access to ride sharing services and to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
